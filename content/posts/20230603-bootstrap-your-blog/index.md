Here is a quick guide on how to bootstrap a blog of your own, just like this one using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [fly.io](https://fly.io).

## Prerequisites

Here is a list of toolings you will need to have installed on your machine:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- [fly.io](https://fly.io)
- [git](https://git-scm.com)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- [Golang](https://golang.org) (optional, but I will be using it in this guide)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (optional, only needed to run the blog locally using Docker)

## Create a new Hugo site

First, we need to create a new Hugo site. To do so, we will use the `hugo new site` command:

```bash
hugo new site my-blog
```

This will create a new folder called `my-blog` with the following structure:

```bash
my-blog
├── archetypes
├── config.toml
├── content
├── data
├── layouts
├── static
└── themes
```

## Add a theme

Next, we need to add a theme to our blog. For this guide, I will be using the [blowfish](https://themes.gohugo.io/blowfish/) theme. 

1. To add a theme, we will use the `hugo mod init` command:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/<username>/<repo-name>
```

2. Now we want to add the theme to our blog, so we will reference it in our `config/_default/module.toml` file:

```toml
# config/_default/module.toml
[[imports]]
path = "github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/v2"
```

3. Start your server using `hugo server` and the theme will be downloaded automatically.

4. In the root folder of your website, delete the config.toml file that was generated by Hugo. Copy the *.toml config files from the theme into your config/_default/ folder.

> **Note:** Do not overwrite the `module.toml` file you created above!

Now so far if we run `hugo server` we will see the following when we access [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313):

![Hugo server](./hugo-server.png)

Now you can start working on your blog following the [blowfish theme documentation](https://blowfish.page/docs/getting-started/).

## Add a Dockerfile

Now that we have our blog ready, we need to add a Dockerfile to our project so we can deploy it to fly.io.

Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.19.0-buster AS build

RUN apt update -y 
RUN apt install -y wget
# Install Hugo
RUN wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.106.0/hugo_extended_0.106.0_linux-amd64.deb
RUN dpkg -i hugo_extended_0.106.0_linux-amd64.deb
RUN apt-get install -f

WORKDIR /var/hugo/src
COPY . .
RUN hugo --minify

EXPOSE 1313
CMD ["hugo", "server", "--bind", "0.0.0.0"]
```

You can try running `docker build .` to build your image locally.

## Important Configurations

Before we jump to the next step, we need to config a few things on our site.

1. First, we need to add a `baseURL` to our `config/_default/config.toml` file:

```toml
# config/_default/config.toml
baseURL = "https://<your-app-name>.fly.dev"
```

2. Next, we need to add a `publishDir` to our `config/_default/config.toml` file:

```toml
# config/_default/config.toml
publishDir = "public"
```

## Hosting on fly.io

Now we can create a new app on fly.io. 

To do so, we will use the `fly launch` command:

```bash
fly launch
```

This will ask you a few questions about your app. Here are the answers I used:

```bash
? App Name (leave blank to use an auto-generated name):
? Select organization: Mark Ericksen (personal)
? Select region: lax (Los Angeles, California (US))
Created app weathered-wave-1020 in organization personal
Wrote config file fly.toml
? Would you like to deploy now? (y/N)
```

The launch command generates a `fly.toml` file for your project with the settings. You can deploy right away, or add some config first.

## Automatic Deployment with GitHub Actions

Now that we have our blog ready, we need to automate the deployment process. To do so, we will use `GitHub Actions`.

1. First, we need to create a new file called `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Fly Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy app
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master
      - run: flyctl deploy --remote-only
        env:
          FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
```

> Make sure you add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your repos environment variables. You can get it from [https://fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens](https://fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens).

## Summary

Now you have a blog of your own, just like this one. You can now start writing your own posts and deploy them to fly.io.
